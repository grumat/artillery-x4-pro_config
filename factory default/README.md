# Factory Default Configuration

This folder conteins the factory defualt configuration for both printer models:
- artillery_X4_plus.cfg
- artillery_X4_pro.cfg

In the case you want to restore factory defaults, pick the one that matches your printer model and rename it to `printer.cfg` then install it into the `/home/mks/klipper_config` directory.
