This files were taken from https://github.com/KiloQubit/probe_accuracy

Two defualt parameter adjustments were done on the original code:
- File `probe_accuracy.py`: Default path of `klippy_uds` changed to match the Artillery implementation.
- File `test_probe_accuracy.cfg`: Bed Temperature reduced to 70°C, since Artillery can't reach 110°C.
