# **My Own Custom Settings for Artillery Sidewinder X4 Pro**

This repository stores my tinkering findings on the Artillery Sidewinder X4 Pro, a 3D printer I own.

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/grumat/artillery-x4-pro_config/wiki) for more information.

> Ready made Klipper images for the these printers can be found on [Artillery SW-X4 Klipper Images](https://sourceforge.net/projects/artillery-sw-x4-klipper-images/) repository.
