# About the Download

The file offered here is a Windows compatible file. This is a tool that fixes common issues in the Artillery Sidewinder X4 Pro and Plus models.

It is not necessary to install this tool. Just run it from your download folder.

To unbrick a printer, you have to use a normal **USB-C cable** connecting your PC to the printer and run the tool. 

The connection uses the fallback speed of 115,200 BAUDS to ensure an error free connection. This may cause connection issues on the first attempt. Retry if necessary.

The tool should work on both printer models and does not harm a printer that it is working normally. This could be of interest, since it cleans lots of clutter files distributed in the original firmware, specially for the PRO firmware.

> *Notice that the tool is in a very preliminary beta stage, and I could only test in my environment.*
