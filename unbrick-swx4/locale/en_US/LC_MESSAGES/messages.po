"- X4-Plus: 800mA (factory setting)\n"
"- Common recommendation: 900mA\n"
"- X4-Pro: 1000mA (factory setting)\n"
"\n"
"What does this mean for you?\n"

"Higher current (e.g., 1000mA): The extruder motor runs hotter, which may "

"Lower current (e.g., 800mA): Motor stays cooler, reducing clog risk. May "

"Recommendation:\n"
"- If you want to reduce fan noise, consider installing a fan duct (available "

"Adjust Heat-Break Fan Speed\n"

"What it does: Lets you reduce the speed of the heat-break fan to lower noise "

"Key Considerations:\n"
"- The heat-break fan prevents filament from softening near the hot-end "

"- The default speed is designed for high-temperature printing (above "
"250°C).\n"
"\n"
"Recommendation:\n"
"- If you rarely print above 250°C, you can safely reduce the fan speed (e."
"g., to 90%), which noticeably lowers noise without risking clogs.\n"
"- Monitor your prints after adjusting — if clogs occur, increase the fan "
